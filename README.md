# mONO [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ontherunvaro/mONO/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/ontherunvaro/mONO/tree/master)

mONO is an open source app that serves as a client area viewer for ONO clients.
It was created because the official app sucks and won't even let some users log in.

## Features
* Will let you log in.
* Will store your username and password for you.
* Will not run around or desert you.

## Have some screenshots

## Contributing

This app is developed on my free time, mostly when I feel like it.
That means it could be much, much better.
